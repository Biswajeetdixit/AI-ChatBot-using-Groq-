##🤖AI ChatBot using Groq 🚀
This project is an AI-powered chatbot application built with Groq's Large Language Models (LLMs) and Streamlit. The chatbot, named Friday, is designed to answer questions with the expertise of an AI assistant. Created by Biswajeet Dixit, Friday is here to help you with questions on various topics, leveraging Groq's advanced LLMs for accurate and engaging responses.

##✨ Features
#1 Interactive Chat Interface: The chatbot is deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly and interactive platform.
#2 Model Selection Slider: Choose between multiple open-source LLMs, such as llama-3.1-8b-instant, gemma2-9b-IT, mixtral-8*7b-32768, and whisper-large-v3, via a dropdown slider. Each model has unique strengths, allowing flexibility in response style and accuracy.
#3 Customizable Response Settings:
3.1 Temperature: Controls the creativity of responses. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes the chatbot more focused and deterministic, while a higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) makes it more creative and varied.
3.2 Max Tokens: Defines the response length. A lower token limit (e.g., 50) keeps responses short, while a higher limit (e.g., 300) allows for more detailed answers.
