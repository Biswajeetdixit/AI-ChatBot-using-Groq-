## ✨ Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: The chatbot is deployed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly and interactive platform.
- **Model Selection Slider**: Choose between multiple open-source LLMs, such as `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `gemma2-9b-IT`, `mixtral-8*7b-32768`, and `whisper-large-v3`, via a dropdown slider. Each model has unique strengths, allowing flexibility in response style and accuracy.
- **Customizable Response Settings**:
    - **🔥 Temperature**: Controls the creativity of responses. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.2) makes the chatbot more focused and deterministic, while a higher temperature (e.g., 0.8) makes it more creative and varied.
    - **📏 Max Tokens**: Defines the response length. A lower token limit (e.g., 50) keeps responses short, while a higher limit (e.g., 300) allows for more detailed answers.
